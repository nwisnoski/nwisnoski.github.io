{"name":"Nathan Wisnoski","tagline":"microbial ecology in space and time","body":"### I am a PhD student in the [Lennon Lab](https://indiana.edu/~microbes) at Indiana University studying microbial ecology. I am particularly interested in exploring the microbial community dynamics of the hyporheic zone, the roles of dormancy & dispersal in maintaining biodiversity, and the constraints of network structure on metacommunity dynamics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Hyporheic microbial ecology\r\n##### The hyporheic zone of a stream is the interface between its surface and ground waters. Hyporheic zones contain rich microbial communities that regulate whole-stream biogeochemistry.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Dormancy and dispersal\r\n##### Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy of many microbial taxa by which cells enter a reversible state of metabolic inactivity. Dormant microbes contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity by \"re-seeding\" the active microbial community when favorable environmental conditions permit. While dormancy provides an avenue for temporal maintenance of diversity, dispersal, the movement of individuals, maintains diversity spatially.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Dendritic metacommunities\r\n##### Metacommunities are local communities linked by dispersal. Understanding how dispersal maintains local and regional diversity within a metacommunity has been well characterized in lattice networks. Dendritic networks are hierarchical and branching in structure, which constrains dispersal rate and directionality.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me by [email](mailto:wisnoski@indiana.edu) and follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nwisnoski).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
