The study of metacommunities in dendritic networks, such as streams, has generated a range of hypotheses about how local and regional-scale processes vary in importance across the stream network. However, dispersal/connectivity also varies along the vertical dimension distinguishing benthic from planktonic habitats. I tested whether these vertical differences influenced the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms across spatial scales and network position in a 5th-order stream network at the [H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest](http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/), a Long-Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) site in Oregon, USA.
