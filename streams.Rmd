Ecological communities do not occur in isolation, but rather, they are connected by the dispersal of potentially interacting species to form a metacommunity. The study of metacommunities in dendritic networks, such as streams, has demonstrated the usefulness of this perspective, generating a range of hypotheses about how local and regional-scale processes vary in importance across the stream network. My research investigates the relative importance of local conditions (e.g., hydrological, chemical, or biotic variables) and dispersal/connectivity for benthic and planktonic bacterial diversity across a 5th-order stream network at the [H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest](http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/), a Long-Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) site in Oregon, USA. This work is conducted in collaboration with [Adam Ward](http://www.indiana.edu/~hydro/).
