title: "About Me"
---


I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Albeke](http://www.uwyo.edu/wygisc/our_research/ongoing_research/ecoinformatics_initiative.html) and [Shoemaker](https://laurenshoemaker.weebly.com/) labs at the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/). I'm working on the [EPSCoR Microbial Ecology](http://www.uwyo.edu/epscor/microbial-ecology/index.html) project investigating spatial patterns in microbial diversity and community structure.
I am especially interested in metacommunity ecology, in particular, how dormancy and dispersal influence communities.

Additional interests of mine include playing guitar and listening to music, reading (add me on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/nawis)), hiking, and nature photography.
