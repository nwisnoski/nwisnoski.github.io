I'm a PhD candidate studying microbial ecology in the [Lennon Lab](http://www.indiana.edu/~microbes/) at [Indiana University](http://www.bio.indiana.edu/). 
I am especially interested in how dormancy and dispersal influence ecological communities.

Check out my research page to learn more about my ongoing projects.

Additional interests of mine include playing guitar and listening to music, reading (add me on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/nawis)), hiking, and nature photography.
